# RoutingEngine
Graph routing engine. Couple of algorithms combined in one library written in Cython

Main features:

 - Read graph from file
 - Route from A to B

What it should do:

 - take A to B points
 - return list of verticies and edges
 - return list of turns

If you are interested, I can provide a paid support for this library.
Also we are reciving a donnations throu PayPal, to continue work on this project.
Catch me on: pzabkiewicz@gmail.com

I can also be involved in commercial projects about graph and
routing algorithms.
